              </ul>
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Calculation methodology</h2>
          <p>
            Depending on the number of judges on the panel, 2 different counting
            principles are used:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>If there are 1-4 judges: Simple system</li>
            <li>If there are 5 or more judges: Olympic system</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Simple system</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The scores for the criteria are summarized for each judge
              separately. This is how the judge's score is obtained.
            </li>
            <li>
              The scores of all judges are averaged and a single final score is
              displayed.
            </li>
            <li>
              If there are penalty points, the sum of the penalty points is
              subtracted from the final score.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Olympic system</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The scores for the criteria are summed up for each judge
              separately. This is how we get the judge's score.
            </li>
            <li>
              The maximum and minimum scores are subtracted from all judges'
              scores.
            </li>
            <li>
              All remaining judges' scores are averaged to get one final score.
            </li>
          </ol>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>judge 1 total score: 60</li>
            <li>judge 2 total score: 70</li>
            <li>judge 3 total score: 80</li>
            <li>judge 4 total score: 90</li>
            <li>judge 5 total score: 40</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Crossed out: 90 (judge 4) and 40 (judge 5)</p>
          <p>
            Total score of the dance team: (60+70+80) / 3 judges = 70 points
          </p>

          <h2>Deduction points</h2>
          <p>
            There are 4 specific categories that we provide point deductions on
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Profanity in music - 0.5 point deduction per curse word</li>
            <li>
              Unapproved Props - 1 point deduction per judge (up to a total of 5
              points deduction to final score)
            </li>
            <li>Music longer than 6 minutes - 0.5 point deduction in total</li>
            <li>Poorly Executed Tricks - 1 point deduction per trick</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong
              >Deduction points will be subtracted from the participant's
              overall average score (final score)</strong
            >
          </p>
          <h2>Score divisions</h2>
          <p>
            <strong
              >According to the World of Dance rules, there are only one 1st,
              2nd and 3rd place in each category of competition.</strong
            >
          </p>
          <p>One prize place = One winner/team of winners.</p>
          <p>
            If two (or more) teams/participants score the same number of points
